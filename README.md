# not active here

I only use this account for contributing to other projects hosted here. My own projects are located on [my personal Forgejo instance](https://git.isincredibly.gay/srxl). If you found a link to a repo that used to be on this profile, it's probably been migrated over there.

# while you're here... consider something else?

[GitHub kinda sucks. Maybe there's better places for your code, too?](https://GiveUpGitHub.org)

To be clear - any use of this my code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done without my permission. I did not consent to GitHub's use of my code in Copilot, even though it's probably in there somewhere. Bastards.
